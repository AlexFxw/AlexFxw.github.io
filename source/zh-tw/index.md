I’m a junior majoring in computer science in Tsinghua University, Beijing. This website is used as a collection of my thinkings and learnings.
I set up the website to jot down some thinking as well as technology learnings. The frequency to update may be irregular. I may use both Chinese and English to write my blog.
I hope that I could pursuing M.S. or M.Engine graduate degree in the U.S.A. if possible. Personally, I prefer working in tech company than doing research yet. I’m interested in human computer interaction, computer vision or other subjects related to AR/VR. Looking for M.S. program and intern opportunity in these fields.
