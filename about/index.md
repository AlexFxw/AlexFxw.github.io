This is a junior majoring in **computer science** in [Tsinghua University](http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/thu2018en/index.html) with a minor of finance in [Tsinghua PBCSF](http://eng.pbcsf.tsinghua.edu.cn/). The website is used as a collection of my thinkings and learnings which may be written in either English or Chinese.

My research interest is mainly about human-computer interaction. The project I'm working with currently is related to pervasive computing which aims to analyze and predict people behavior with RFID sensors in the environment. In addition to **pervasive computing, VR/AR** research fascinates me as well. I plan to pursue human-computer interaction graduate degree program in the U.S.A. after graduation.

**Looking forward to summer research intern opportunity or other collaboration form in these fields.**
